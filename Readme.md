# RobolabStatistics
This is more like an Opencv-Laboratory than an actual project. 

To see the whole definition (in German see) see: [Pflichtenheft](docs/pflichtenheft/Pflichtenheft.md)

## File Structure
### SRC
The src folder contains useable applications.
### Training
The training folder contains some demo-projects which have
no more use than to help you understand some features of
whatever. Some of them are mere experiments and some of
them are proper prototypes for the final source-apps.

To see how to create such an Training-Project please see
the [Readme](training/Gradle_Demo/README.md) inside the
`Gradle_Demo` training-project.
